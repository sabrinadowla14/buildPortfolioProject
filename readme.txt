Project: Build a Portfolio Site

Documentation of my Project:
Contents are taken from websites and Instructors Notes.
I was provided with a design mockup as a PDF-file and\
replicate that design in HTML and CSS. I developed a responsive\
website that displays images, descriptions and links to each of\ 
the portfolio projects I will complete throughout the course of my Nanodegree program.

I have a folder callded FinalProject_Portfolio where\ 
I have three folders - Images, js and css and one index file.
In images folder I have the customized logo called browser-pic.jpg. 
In js folder I have all my java script files and\
in css folder I have all my css files.
Import fonts from the website.
Created a styles.css file.
I have 8 images title text (h1, h2, etc.)
regular (paragraph) text
All div contain a CSS class or id.
Used Grid-Based Layout.
I have followed css and HTML guidelines.

TEST:
1.Cross-Device Compatibility- All content is responsive\
and displays on all display sizes. This includes:
Desktop
Mobile: Google Nexus 5
Tablet: Apple iPad
No content is hidden on mobile devices.

2. Viewport meta tag is included in HTML. ( <meta name=”viewport” …)

3. CSS framework is used,
 classes provided by the CSS framework are used to make images responsive,
 otherwise media-queries are used to ensure responsiveness of images.
 
4. Files are organized with a directory structure that separates files based on functionality.
For example:
css/ for stylesheets
img/ for images
js/ for JavaScript files


 
   Steps to Run a Portfolio Site:
   installed Sublime Text 3.0
   Step1: Open the folder - FinalProject_Portfolio in sublime text.
   Step2: Right click on index.html file
   Step3: Open it in the browser.
   step4: Make the screen smaller to check the output in differnt sizes.
   Step5: Open it in devtools to check the output for different devices.
   
   
   

   Issues:
   When I was trying to see the output from Microsoft Edge I was not able to see the
   logo images but I could see it from Google Chrome.
   Sometime images are not loaded in the browser, need to refresh it.
   My bootstrap was not working when I was using the minified one, added the cdn one.
